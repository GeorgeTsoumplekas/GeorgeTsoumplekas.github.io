I am a Researcher at Kingston University. Prior to that, I worked as an AI Researcher / Engineer at [MetaMind Innovations](https://metamind.gr/el/). I received my Diploma (combined BSc & MSc) from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in July, 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I was a member of the [ISSEL](https://lab.issel.ee.auth.gr/) lab, fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Pericles Mitkas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pericles-a-mitkas-08a23611/). My diploma thesis was on Few-Shot Learning Models for Load Forecasting in Smart Grids.

I am broadly interested in machine learning and particularly in generative AI, few-shot learning and learning with limited supervision. Recently, I have been working on multi-concept customisation of diffusion models. I have also contributed to projects related to few-shot object/instance detection, energy-efficient machine learning with limited data and federated learning.
