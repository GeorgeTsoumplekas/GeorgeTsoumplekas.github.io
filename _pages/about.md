I am an AI Researcher / Engineer at [MetaMind Innovations](https://metamind.gr/el/). Prior to that, I received my Diploma (MSc & BSc) from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in July, 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I was a member of the [ISSEL](https://lab.issel.ee.auth.gr/) lab, fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Pericles Mitkas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pericles-a-mitkas-08a23611/). My diploma thesis was on Few-Shot Learning Models for Load Forecasting in Smart Grids.

I am broadly interested in machine learning and particularly in few-shot learning, meta-learning and learning with limited supervision. Recently, I have been working on few-shot object/instance detection and energy-efficient machine learning with limited data. I have also contributed to projects related to federated learning.

### News

* \[08/2024\]: Our [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10940) on the energy-efficiency of data augmentation strategies for few-shot object detection has been accepted in [IEEE SIES 2024](https://ieee-sies.org/).
* \[08/2024\]: I will attend the International Conference on AI in Healthcare ([AIiH](https://aiih.cc/)) where I will present our [work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20430) on tackling class imbalance in federated learning settings. See you in Swansea!
